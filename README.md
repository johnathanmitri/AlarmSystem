# AlarmSystem

This is a work-in-progress Alarm System. The goal was to make a full Alarm System to use in my own house. 

The User Interface is an Android App that would be installed on our devices. 

To monitor the zones (Doors, Windows, Motion), Arduinos are used. Monitoring a door is easy with a Magnet in the door, and a Magnetic Reed Switch in the door frame. To simulate this, I am simply opening and closing the circuit for each zone with a breadboard. 

Heres a demo of the zones being updated in real time as doors are "Opened" and "Closed":
